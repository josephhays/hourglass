## Hourglass | Simple, elegant time-punching software for on-field technicians

#### What is Hourglass?
Hourglass is a clean, easy to use and lightweight time-clock app tailored for on-the-job service technicians.
The software is optimized to run on mobile networks, so your employees can punch in and out with their cellular phones
from any job-site without a hitch.

#### What Hourglass is NOT:
Before spending time on installing and configuring Hourglass, keep in mind Hourglass is not designed as a
featured enterprise managing program. This program is designed to do a single task, albeit very well.

#### Why choose Hourglass?
- Lightweight and resource friendly, Hourglass is built with a beautiful environment, with zero images, creating an extremely small data footprint, perfect for shared business cellular options and roaming.
